Mini Project Report (So Others Can Join & Contribute)

This is a clean “status report” you can drop into:

Hackathon submission explanation

📘 Project Status Report (Current Milestone)
🔍 What Has Been Built So Far
1️⃣ File Parsing (Deterministic)

CSV / XLSX / text-based PDF supported

Standardized to a clean pandas DataFrame

Required columns validated

No AI used

Location:
services/file_parser.py
notebook/01_file_parsing.ipynb

2️⃣ Financial Metrics Engine (Deterministic)

Revenue & expense aggregation

Cash flow calculation

Profit margin

Working capital indicators

Output is a plain Python dictionary

Location:
services/metrics.py
notebook/02_financial_metrics.ipynb

3️⃣ Rule-Based Risk Engine (Deterministic)

Cash flow risk

Expense concentration risk

Credit/debt exposure

Transparent rule logic

Fully explainable (no black box)

Location:
services/risk_engine.py
notebook/02_financial_metrics.ipynb

4️⃣ AI Explanation Layer (LangGraph)

AI is not used for calculations

AI only explains:

Financial health

Risks

Improvement suggestions

Parallel LangGraph nodes:

Health summary

Risk explanation

Suggestions

Final compiler node merges outputs

Token usage controlled per node

Location:
services/ai_service.py
notebook/03_ai_langgraph.ipynb

🛡 Anti-Hallucination Guarantees

✔ AI sees only text summaries
✔ No raw financial data sent
✔ No number generation by AI
✔ Deterministic → AI → Presentation separation

This makes the system:

Audit-friendly

Regulator-safe

Judge-friendly

🚧 What Is Left To Build (Future Steps)
🔜 STEP 5 — Backend API Wiring

routes/analysis.py

Combine parser → metrics → risk → AI

Single /analyze endpoint

🔜 STEP 6 — Frontend Dashboard

Upload financial file

Visualize metrics

Show AI report

Risk badges & charts

🔜 STEP 7 — Multilingual Output

English → Hindi (AI translation node)

Optional toggle in UI

🔜 STEP 8 — Deployment

Backend: Render

Frontend: Vercel

Database: Render PostgreSQL
