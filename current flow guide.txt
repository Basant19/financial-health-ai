Problem Description 
Create a comprehensive financial health assessment platform for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that uses AI to analyze financial statements, cash flow patterns, and business metrics to provide actionable insights and recommendations. The system should evaluate creditworthiness, identify financial risks, suggest cost optimization strategies, and recommend suitable financial products from banks and NBFCs. Advanced features include automated bookkeeping assistance, tax compliance checking, financial forecasting, working capital optimization, and integration with GST returns and banking APIs. The platform must handle multiple business types, provide industry-specific benchmarking, generate investor-ready financial reports, and offer multilingual support for regional business owners. The solution must maintain high security standards, ensure regulatory compliance, and provide clear visualization of financial metrics for non-finance business owners. Data Requirements Supported Input Sources: Uploaded documents: CSV / XLSX / PDF (text-based exports) Optional API integrations: ▸ Max 2 banking/payment APIs ▸ Optional GST filing data import Data Dimensions: Revenue streams Cost structures Expense categories Accounts receivable/payable Inventory levels (if applicable) Loan/credit obligations Tax deductions & compliance metadata Industry Segmentation: Manufacturing, Retail, Agriculture, Services, Logistics, E-commerce, etc. Multilingual Outputs: English + optionally Hindi/Regional Tooling Restrictions Allowed tooling stack: LLM: OpenAI GPT-5 or Claude (recommendation & narrative layer) Data Processing: Python (pandas) Frontend: React.js or Angular for visuals Database: PostgreSQL for secure storage Integrations: Max 2 banking/payment APIs Security: Mandatory encryption for all financial data at rest & in transit Submission Requirements Your solution must be based on the same problem statement you selected in the first phase. 
Submissions based on a different problem will not be considered. You must submit the following: Live deployed URL (must be publicly accessible) GitHub repository link YouTube or Google Drive demo video link (must be public) Project description explaining what you've built and how it solves the problem All submissions must be made before the deadline. Late submissions will not be accepted.







📘 PROJECT REPORT & BUILD GUIDE
Financial Health Assessment Tool for SMEs (Hackathon Version)
0️⃣ CORE PHILOSOPHY (ANTI-HALLUCINATION STRATEGY)
How we strictly avoid AI hallucination

This project does not allow AI to invent numbers or financial facts.

AI is used only for:

Explaining already-calculated results

Providing suggestions based on deterministic metrics

Translating output (English → Hindi / regional)

All financial logic is:

Rule-based

Deterministic

Implemented in Python using pandas

👉 This ensures explainability, auditability, and regulatory friendliness.

1️⃣ SYSTEM FLOW (MEMORY ANCHOR)

Upload data → Clean & standardize → Calculate metrics → Apply risk rules → AI explanation → Visualize

If you remember this one line, you remember the entire project.

2️⃣ TECH STACK (STRICTLY AS PER PROBLEM STATEMENT)

Backend	Python (FastAPI / Flask)
Data Processing	pandas
AI Layer	OpenAI GPT-5 or Claude

Current Status

Backend & Core Features

File upload (CSV/XLSX/PDF) works ✅

Financial metrics computation (revenue, expenses, cashflow, etc.) ✅

Rule-based financial risk evaluation (profitability, cashflow, expense load) ✅

Deterministic AI explanations via GPT-5, with fallback logic when API fails ✅

SMEAnalysis entries are correctly saved to PostgreSQL ✅

Pytest framework for /analysis/run route works, with cleanup fixture to avoid DB pollution ✅

Logging & Debug

Full logging of each step is operational (parsing, metrics, risk, AI, DB save) ✅

AI fallback triggered correctly when JSON parsing fails; deterministic output still generated ✅

Clean start/shutdown of FastAPI + uvicorn verified ✅

Frontend & API

React frontend is ready for integration

/analysis/run API returning structured JSON with financial_summary, credit_readiness, recommendations, ai_report, meta ✅

⚡ Next Phase: Multilingual Support

Problem Statement Requirement: English + optionally Hindi / regional outputs

Proposed Approach:

Translation Layer

Create backend/services/translation.py

Implement a function translate_text(text: str, target_lang: str) using GPT-5 or a lightweight rule-based fallback.

Target languages: "en" (default), "hi" (Hindi), optionally other regional codes "ta", "bn", etc.

Example integration in AI layer:

from .translation import translate_text

ai_report_en = generate_ai_report(metrics, risk)
ai_report_hi = translate_text(ai_report_en, target_lang="hi")


API Changes

Accept query param language in /analysis/run?language=en|hi

Serve ai_report in requested language

Update meta["language"] to reflect output language

Test Coverage

Add Pytest tests for multilingual output

/analysis/run?language=hi → ai_report in Hindi

Assert length > 100, section headers translated

Ensure deterministic fallback also gets translated

Frontend Integration

React select dropdown for language

Dynamically fetch /analysis/run?language=<selected>

Render multilingual AI explanations

💡 Recommendation for Implementation Order

Backend Translation Module

Lightweight at first (only AI report)

Use GPT-5 API or static dictionary fallback

API Language Param

Minimal changes to /analysis/run route

Default language="en"

Tests

Add multilingual Pytest cases

Ensure cleanup fixture still works

Frontend

Add language selector UI

Consume multilingual endpoint
